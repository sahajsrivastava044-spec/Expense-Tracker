## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1. User registers an account.
2. Password is securely hashed using bcrypt.
3. User logs in with email and password.
4. Server generates a JWT token.
5. Token is stored in Local Storage.
6. Frontend sends token with every protected request.
7. Backend middleware validates the token before granting access.
